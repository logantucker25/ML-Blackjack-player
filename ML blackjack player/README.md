### Training Game Number
*We decided to train the Player with 10,000 games. We settled on this figure because the training duration was brief enough for us to wait for it to complete in one sitting, but thorough enough to give us data on most possible scenarios.*

When we run player with valgrind against the dealer-given, we get an error (join message incorrectly recieved). This does not happen when we run against dealer-given without valgrind.
