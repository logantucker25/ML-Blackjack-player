* Write up on how many games played in training (2/3) - looking for something less subjective and more mathematical regarding number of games played. example from rubric: "look for a description that says each state has been played at least 30 times (30 is a little subjective, accept numbers around this many, but not if they say something like "we played each state at least once"). It will take many times for the estimate of the reward to converge to the true estimate."
